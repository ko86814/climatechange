# Climate change

Climate change is a massive global problem. According to NASA, humans are currently warming the planet and the effects of this warming will be irreversible.

## What are the causes

* The use of fossil fuels like oil is the main cause of global warming.
* Climate change is caused by human activities, not natural patterns.
* In fact, the planet would be getting colder if humans didn't exist.
* CO2 (carbon dioxide) is produced by the use of fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide warms the planet.
* The way carbon dioxide warms the planet is through the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide traps heat inside of the atmosphere.
* Methane is another greenhouse gas. It is much more powerful than carbon dioxide.
* However, there is less methane in the atmosphere.
* Therefore, carbon dioxide contributes to climate change much more than methane.

## The effects of climate change

* Animal and plant ranges and habitats are changed by climate change.
* Ice is melting causing animals to die and the sea level to rise.
* Heat waves will be more intense because of climate change.
* There will be more storms and they will be stronger because of climate change.
* The effects of climate change like stronger hurricanes will cost a ton of money.
* The effects of climate change are irreversible.

## How to stop climate change

* The more renewable energy (things like solar power) people use, the less climate change will happen
* You can help by using less power
