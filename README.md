# Climate change

Climate change is a massive global problem. According to NASA, humans are currently warming the planet and the effects of this warming will be irreversible. 

## What are the causes

* The use of fossil fuels like oil is the main cause of global warming.
* Climate change is caused by human activities, not natural patterns.
* In fact, the planet would be getting colder if humans didn't exist.
* CO2 (carbon dioxide) is produced by the use of fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide warms the planet.
* The way carbon dioxide warms the planet is through the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide traps heat inside of the atmosphere.
